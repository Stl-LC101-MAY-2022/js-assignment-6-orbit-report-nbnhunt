<!-- TODO 4: add logic to count number of satellites displayed 

	structural directive: *ngIF, *ngFor

	<td [class.warning]="satellites.isSpaceDebris()">{{satellites.type}}</td>

	THIS IS WHERE YOU LEFT OFF. YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT TO DO, IT LOOKS
	LIKE YOU ARE DOING THE SAME STUFF FOR ORBIT-LIST HERE WITH ORBIT-COUNT
	"JUST USE THE SATELLITE PROPERTY" TO PASS
